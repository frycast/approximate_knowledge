<p>&ldquo;Practicing diplomats and politicians have often found their margin
of success depends on their ability to seize upon unique twists
in the political or psychological environment, twists which allow
the individual to escape the seemingly uncontrollable tide of events
that one would expect a mathematical model to extrapolate&hellip;
one achieves a greater &lsquo;benefit&rsquo; within a given &lsquo;cost-constraint,&rsquo;
not by being tight and precise about budgeting one&rsquo;s resources,
but rather by preserving the detachment and freedom one will need
in order to seize upon whole new options.&rdquo;</br>

<p>Paul Werbos was the first (in the US) to propose using the
Backpropagation algorithm for neural nets. He did so in his 1974
PhD thesis titled &lsquo;Beyond Regression: New Tools for Prediction and
Analysis in the Behavioral Sciences.&rsquo; The above quote was part of
an argument for why political scientists may be skeptical of
mathematical models. Werbos goes on to critique the ability of
regression models to predict the future, and to discuss the
nature of &lsquo;truth&rsquo; in statistics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is an old saying &lsquo;If all a man has is a hammer, then every problem looks like a nail.&rsquo;
The trouble for statisticians is that recently some of the problems have stopped looking
like nails. I conjecture that the result of hitting this wall is that more complicated
data models are appearing in current published applications. Bayesian methods combined
with Markov Chain Monte Carlo are cropping up all over. This may signify that as data
becomes more complex, the data models become more cumbersome and are losing
the advantage of presenting a simple and clear picture of nature&rsquo;s mechanism.&rdquo;</br>

<p>The gap between the automatic differentiation community and the neural network community
reminds me of a split I once saw between some people making aircraft
engines and people making aircraft bodies. When the engine people work
on their own, without integrating their work with the airframes,
they will find only limited markets for their product. The same goes for
airframe people working alone. Only when the engine and the airframe
are combined together, into an integrated product, can we obtain a
real airplane – a product of great power and general interest.</br>

<p>&ldquo;There are good reasons why the theorems should all be easy and the definitions hard.
As the evolution of Stokes&rsquo; Theorem revealed, a single simple principle can masquerade
as several difficult results; the proofs of many theorems involve merely stripping away
the disguise. The  definitions, on the other hand, serve a twofold purpose: they are
rigorous replacements for vague notions, and machinery for elegant  proofs.&rdquo; </br>

His lambda calculus is ignored because it is insufficiently C-like.
This criticism occurs in spite of the fact that C has not yet been invented.&rdquo;</br>
