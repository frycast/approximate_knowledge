Paul Werbos was the first (in the US) to propose using the
Backpropagation algorithm for neural nets. He did so in his 1974
PhD thesis titled 'Beyond Regression: New Tools for Prediction and 
Analysis in the Behavioral Sciences.' The above quote was part of
an argument for why political scientists may be skeptical of 
mathematical models. Werbos goes on to critique the ability of 
regression models to predict the future, and to discuss the
nature of 'truth' in statistics.


> "There is an old saying 'If all a man has is a hammer, then every problem looks like a nail.' 
> The trouble for statisticians is that recently some of the problems have stopped looking 
> like nails. I conjecture that the result of hitting this wall is that more complicated 
> data models are appearing in current published applications. Bayesian methods combined 
> with Markov Chain Monte Carlo are cropping up all over. This may signify that as data 
> becomes more complex, the data models become more cumbersome and are losing 
> the advantage of presenting a simple and clear picture of nature's mechanism."</br>
