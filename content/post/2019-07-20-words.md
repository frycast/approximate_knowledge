Use words for brevity and clarity.
Also, misuse words for comedy, or bravity.

##### Contradistinction </font>
The difference between two or more things that is made clear by comparing them:

* *I use the term "child" in contradistinction to "parent" - it does not necessarily refer to a juvenile.* - [Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/contradistinction)

* *Inferential role semantics is an approach to the theory of meaning that identifies the meaning of an expression with its relationship to other expressions, in contradistinction to denotationalism, according to which denotations are the primary sort of meaning.* - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferential_role_semantics)




<font color="blue"> 
##### Contemporaneous </font>
happening or existing at the same period of time:

* *The two events were more or less contemporaneous, with only months between them.* - [Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/contemporaneous)
